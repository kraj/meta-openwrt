Subject: [PATCH] [resolv.conf.auto]: Use /run instead of /tmp

Using netifd as network manager along with systemd provokes the bad usage
of path, in this case /tmp/. All the runtime configuration needs to be
sotored as part of /run

Problem:
========
assuming: ln -fs /tmp/resolv.conf.auto /etc/resolv.conf

If any application tend to use Filesystem namespace to have separate /tmp and
try to use DNS resolution from netifd, it will not be able to resolve the path/symlink.

Usage of PrivateTmp=yes:
------------------------
For example, systemd-timesyncd.service in systemd uses the option "PrivateTmp=yes"
in the service file to have separate /tmp filesystem namespace and uses glibc
getaddrinfo for name resolution, which in turm follows the symlink to /tmp which
doesn't exit in new namespace

So moving the runtime configuration to /run here
